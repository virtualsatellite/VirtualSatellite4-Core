== Introduction

Virtual Satellite can be run headless as a server.
That allows you to connect Virtual Satellite to a network, e.g. the Internet.
The REST API can be used to access and manipulate the Virtual Satellite model remotely and without the desktop interface.
It provides the Model in form of Resources that can be manipulated via the standard HTTP commands GET, PUT, POST and DELETE.

The Server functions as a general-purpose interface to connect Virtual Satellite to your own application.
For example the API could be called via JavaScript, that runs inside your Browser, from within a Python program or directly from the command line.

You will learn about the Servers Architecture in the next chapter.
If you are interested in connecting the Server to your own application, refer to <<The REST API>>.
Or if you want to set up your own Server, then refer to <<How to run your own Headless Virtual Satellite Server>>.

== Architecture of the Virtual Satellite Server

In this chapter an overview and a more in depth description of the Servers Functionality and Components is given.

=== Overview

The Figure <<RestServerOverview>> gives an overview of the Server and its environment.

A Server instance can maintain multiple _Server Repositories_, with each repository connected to a _git_ or _SVN repository_.
_REST Clients_ can access the Server using the HTTP commands GET, PUT, DELETE and POST. 
So a Client can read or write into the Virtual Satellite model. 
The server provides functionality for administrators, that can manipulate the server configuration, and users.
For that purpose it uses authentication and authorization.
// For authentication purposes it is planned to an LDAP server can be connected to the REST server.
The connection can be secured via HTTPS.
The server uses the port 8000 for HTTP and 8443 for HTTPS requests.
Each user can only access the _Server Repositories_ to which he has been granted access.

The connected SVN/git repositories can also be manipulated from _Clients using the Virtual Satellite UI_.
The server resolves these conflicts and also handles simultaneous changes from multiple REST clients.
The SVN/git repository is supposed to be the single source of truth in those cases.

=== Components

Figure <<RestServerComponents>> gives a more detailed view on the REST Server components.

.Components of the Headless REST Server.
[#RestServerComponents]
image::chapterServerComponents/REST_server_components.png[Server Components]

The server is divided into three main layers: the _REST API_ (View), _Server Controller_ and _Persistence_ (Model).
Between the API and the controller also is an _Access check_ layer.

A REST Client can send a request to the provided _REST API_ that is partitioned into multiple Resources:
An _Admin Resource_, in which an administrator can manipulate the Server Configuration (_ServerConf_), e.g. add Repository Configurations (_RepoConf_),
and a _Repository Resource_. Each _Server Repository_ provided has its own _Subresource_.

In the _Access check_ layer the credentials are obtained from the HTTP Header and it is checked if the requested Resources can be accessed.
The credentials are handed over to be used for user role handling in the Virtual Satellite _Data Model_.

The _Server Controller_ handles requests to the _Admin Resource_. In its _ServerConf_ the server settings are stored.
Requests to a specific _Repository Subresource_ via the _Repository Resource_ directly change the underlying _Data Model_.

The persistence level is composed of _Server Repositories_, each with a _Repository Configuration_ and a _Data Model_. 
The _Data Model_ is connected to a _SVN_ or _git_ backend.

== The REST API

The REST API can be accessed via the 
[subs=+quotes]
....
{*server adress*}:{*http/https port*}/rest
....
and currently supports multiple APIs for different purposes.
Each API can be accessed via it's *name* and *version number*:
[subs=+quotes]
....
{*server adress*}:{*http/https port*}/rest/{*name*}/{*version number*}
....

Currently the following APIs are provided:

* The Model API to access Virtual Satellite Models ({*name*} = *model*)
* The Management API for administrative tasks ({*name*} = *management*)

The following documentation of the REST endpoints is automatically generated using Swagger.
For each API the swagger documentation also is provided via the REST API at:
[subs=+quotes]
....
{*server adress*}:{*http/https port*}/rest/{*name*}/{*version number*}/swagger.json or /swagger.yaml
....

It can help you, if you want to connect Virtual Satellite to your own application.
E.g. it can be used to automatically generate your client, using Swaggers Codegen capabilities.

WARNING: Important concept: Inheritance

Some resources in the following documentation return abstract model classes (e.g. AClass).
Here the server will instead return the concrete model class (e.g. ConcreteClass) inheriting from AClass.
So the JSON will contain all fields from AClass, but may contain additional fields.
Furthermore, a *type* field will be inserted, identifying the concrete class. 
So the JSON for ConcreteClass will look like this:
....
{
  "type" : "concreteClass",
  // fields from AClass e.g. uuid
  "uuid" : ...,
  ...
  // fields from ConcreteClass
  ...
}
....
This concept is most relevant for CategoryAssignments, which can additionally have
fields in the form of Properties.

NOTE: Now follows the generated documentation

== How to run your own Headless Virtual Satellite Server

In this chapter you will learn how to setup and configure your own Virtual Satellite Server.

:step: 0
[%header,cols=">8,62a,40a"] 
|===

|Step
|Task
|Image

|{counter:step}.
|Download the Virtual Satellite Server zip-file from the GitHub releases section.
|image:chapterInstallation/DownloadGitHubRelease.png[Download]

|{counter:step}.
|Create a new folder structure in an empty directory.
|....
├───repositories
└───repository_configs
....


|{counter:step}.
|Create a server configuration file that contains all required configuration. See <<The Configuration File>>.
[TIP]
The paths of *repositories* and *repository_configurations* are defined in the 
*server.properties*. So you could locate them anywhere in the file system.
|....
│   server.properties
├───repositories
└───repository_configs
....

|{counter:step}.
|
NOTE: Optional:

Now you can add repositories manually, e.g. *demo1* and *demo2*.
See <<How to add a Repository manually instead of using the REST API>>.

TIP: Instead you can also use the Management API of the running Server.
|....
│   server.properties
├───repositories
└───repository_configs
        demo1.repository
        demo2.repository
....

|{counter:step}.
|Start the Server executable with:
[subs=+quotes]
....
*"-configFile {path to server.properties}"*
....

The Server will start and try to load the repositories defined in 
*repository_configurations* into the *repositories* folder.
|Results in:
....
│   server.properties
├───repositories
│   ├───repo_demo1
│   └───repo_demo2
└───repository_configs
        demo1.repository
        demo2.repository
....

|{counter:step}.
|Send your first request to the server!
The server provides a status endpoint that can be accessed without authentication and repositories.
Send a HTTP/S GET request to the following address:
[subs=+quotes]
....
{*server adress*}:{*http/https port*}/status
....
|
The server should return HTTP status OK (200) and the following response body:
....
{
	"status": "ok"
}
....

|===

=== The Configuration File
[WARNING]
This file should be stored in a secure location on the server.

[WARNING]
.Connection is UNSECURED by default
====
By default the REST server communicates over HTTP, so your credentials (username and password) are transmitted unencrypted.
====

TIP: Configure the server to use the secure HTTPS connection.

By convention this file is named *server.properties*:

.server.properties
[[server-properties]]
[subs=+quotes]
....
# Directory in which repository configurations are stored
*repository.configurations.dir* = ...
 
# Directory into which all projects will be checked out from their repositories
# *NOT* the workspace
*project.repositories.dir* = ...
 
# Class of the login service
*login.service.class* = *org.eclipse.jetty.security.HashLoginService*
 
# Location of the .properties file for authentication 
# *WARNING*: will only be used if the HashLoginService is used
*auth.properties.file* = ...

# "true" if HTTPS should be enabled
*https.enabled* = 
# Path to the JSSE keystore containing the certificates (by JDKs keytool)
*https.keystore.path* = 
# Password for the keystore
*https.keystore.password* = 
# Optional password for the key "jetty", will default to https.keystore.password if left empty
*https.keystore.manager.password* = 
# "true" if HTTP should be disabled (*WARNING*: will only be used if HTTPS is enabled)
*https.only* = 
....

To use HTTPS you have to enable it in the server configuration and provide a certificate that is stored in a JSSE keystore.
Such a keystore can be created and managed (e.g. create or add certificates) via the JDKs keytool.
The server will use the certificate stored with the key "jetty", that is secured by the keystore password and an optional password for the key.
HTTP can be disabled in the server configuration if HTTPS is enabled.

TIP: For more information regarding the keystore you can refer to the Jetty, JSSE and keytool documentation.

=== The Authentication File
[WARNING]
This file should be stored in a secure location on the server.

This file persists the known users and their roles. The server currently supports the following roles:

[%header,cols=">8,102a"] 
|===

|Role
|Permission

|ADMIN
|Can access all resources on the server. This includes the Management API and all repositories.

|USER
|Can access resources available to users, has to be granted access to the specific repositories (see below).

|repositoryName
|A USER with this role can also access this repository. Has no effect on ADMINs.

|===

An example configuration:

[subs=+quotes]
....
# Properties for user authentication with entries in the format:
# username: password[,rolename ...]
admin: password,ADMIN
user: password,USER
user2: password,USER,testRepository
....

Only the _admin_ can access the Management API. Only _admin_ and _user2_ can access the _testRepository_.

=== How to add a Repository manually instead of using the REST API

Create a {*repository*}.properties file located in *repository.configurations.dir* (see <<server-properties>>):

.{*repository*}.properties
[subs=+quotes]
....
# The name of the project in the repository
*project.name* = ...
*repository.backend* = {*GIT* or *SVN*}
*repository.remoteURI* = {*uri*}
*repository.localPath* = {*localPath*}
*repository.credentials.username* = ...
*repository.credentials.password* = ...
....

This will checkout the project located in the folder {*localPath*} in the repository at {*uri*} into *project.repositories.dir*/repo_{*name*} at the next Server start.
