== Getting Started

Learn about basic requirements of Virtual Satellite Developers IDE, how it is installed and begin your first development.

=== System Requirements 

Virtual Satellite Developer IDE is based on the Eclipse for Plugin Developer.
It has been extended by some additional tools that we require for our development, e.g. checkstyle or overtarget.
Additionally, the IDE contains the Concept Language, the implementation of the Generic Systems Engineering Language (GSEL).
This language is based on xtext and it is the simple entry point to start enhancing the Conceptual Data Model of Virtual Satellite for your individual needs. 

The Developers IDE currently supports the following operating system configurations:

. Windows 7 64bit with Java 8 runtime environment
. Linux 64 bit with Java 8 runtime environment

[WARNING]
.Use 64 bit Java JRE
====
Virtual Satellite does not execute on a Java 32 bit runtime environment.
====

NOTE: The Developers IDE supports newer Java versions same as eclipse. Nevertheless, Virtual Satellite still requires Java version 8. 

=== Different Ways to Develop Virtual Satellite

Virtual Satellite offers three different ways to be a developer. 
All of them require different sets of skills and offer different ways of contributing.

The first set is called *Virtual Satellite App Developer*.
Developing an App is described in the User Manual.
Apps are usually programmed directly within a project and contain project specific processing of the modeled data.
Apps can be developed directly from within Virtual Satellite and do not require special setup.

The second way is called the *Virtual Satellite Concept Developer*. 
A Concept is an extension to the Virtual Satellite Conceptual Data Model (CDM).
A Concept offers new ways of modeling to the user. 
These new ways are usually process specific, meaning depending on your understanding of modeling a spacecraft.
Once a Concept is developed it can be deployed and installed into any Virtual Satellite instance.
Thus a Concept can be easily shared and reused across projects.
Developing a concept requires some programming skills and requires to install the Virtual Satellite Developer IDE.
A Concept is developed based on the Concept Language which is an xtext implementation of our Generic Systems Engineering Language (GSEL).
This xtext language is an easy to use entry point to create new modeling items.
Code generators create all neccessary code to get started.
More advanced developers can override this generated code for further detailed modifications.

The third way is called *Virtual Satellite Infrastructure Developers*.
infrastructure Developers work on the core and basis of Virtual Satellite.
This requires a high knowledge of Virtual Satellite, Eclipse and Java.
It also requires to install the Virtual Satellite Developer IDE.

=== The Modular Conceptual Data Model

=== Virtual Satellite / Eclipse IDE Installation

=== Third party JAR libraries

The simplest way to load a third party JAR library is to pack it into an OSGI/Equinox plugin.
This plugin can then be used as a dependency wherever it is needed.
The following example shows how a library such as `json-simple` is integrated. The Figure "<<ExternalLibraryJson-Simple-Bundled>>" shows the file structure of the plugin.

.The external third party library json-simple bundled into a plugin.
[#ExternalLibraryJson-Simple-Bundled]
image::chapterExternalLibraries/TheJsonSimpleTPL.png[Json-Simple External Library]
 
Third party libraries get placed into the `externalLib` folder.
The sources are usually placed here as well for legal reasons.
The individual licenses and related files are stored in the `about_files` folder and mentioned in `about.html`.
Now, to make these libraries accessible from other plugins three things need to be done.

First, these libraries have to be added to the runtime classpath of the plugin as shown in Figure "<<ExternalLibraryClassPathAndPackages>>".
This can be done from the _Manifest Editor_.
The classpath gets extended by adding the new library on the _Runtime_ tab.
Then the packages of the imported library can be exported.

[#ExternalLibraryClassPathAndPackages]
image::chapterExternalLibraries/ManifestRuntimeTab.png[Manifest Editor]

Second, the external library has to be bundled into the plugin.
This way the jar which extends the runtime classpath is present and can actually be loaded.
In the _Build_ tab of the _Manifest Editor_, the `externalLib` folder and all of its sub-folders and files should be marked for the _binary build_ as shown in Figure "<<ExternalLibraryBinaryBuild>>". 

.The Manifest Editor for updating the binary build.
[#ExternalLibraryBinaryBuild]
image::chapterExternalLibraries/BuildPropertiesExternal.png[Build Properties Editor]

Third and finally, the library has to be registered for correct compilation in eclipse.
Therefore it has to be added to the build class path of the plugin.
The _Build Path Editor_  in Figure "ExternalLibraryBuildPath" can be accessed by the context menu menu:Context[Build Path > Configure Build Path...].
The libraries of the `externalLib` folder have to be listed here.
Additionally they can be linked with their source or javadoc libraries as well.

=== Platform-specific external libraries

When DLLs on Windows or so-libraries on Linux are required, bundling them and using them becomes a bit more complicated.
On Windows it is still possible to bundle them and to ship them with Virtual Satellite.
On Linux, due to the various different distributions, most libraries have to be compiled and linked to the specific system libraries.
Therefore, they cannot be shipped and bundled.
The following chapters will show how to prepare and use such platform-specific libraries with Virtual Satellite.

=== Platform-specific DLL libraries on Windows

The library `de.dlr.sc.virsat.external.lib.zmq.win32.x86_64` presents a good example for a Windows platform-specific third party library.
It bundles the DLLs for ZeroMQ plus the jar to make it available in other plugins.
Similar to the general third party libraries, the jar is placed in the _native_lib_ folder.
The Windows DLLs are placed here as well.
All these files are selected for the binary build in the _build.properties_.
As a consequence, they get exported into the final jar.
The jar is itself is included into the classpath as described in <<Third party JAR libraries>>.
A major difference is explained in the _MANIFEST.MF_

.MANIFEST.MF file of the windows specific ZeroMQ external library
[#ExternalLibraryManifestMfWin32]
----
Manifest-Version: 1.0
Bundle-ManifestVersion: 2
Bundle-Name: VirSat External Lib - JZMQ and ZeroMQ Native Libraries for 64-Bit Win32
Bundle-SymbolicName: de.dlr.sc.virsat.external.lib.zmq.win32.x86_64;singleton:=true
Bundle-Version: 4.9.1.qualifier
Bundle-Vendor: DLR (German Aerospace Center)

Automatic-Module-Name: de.dlr.sc.virsat.external.lib.zmq.win32.x86_64
----
<1> This statement defines the platform filter.
This means that the plugin is only executed on a win32 64 bit environment.
On other environments the Equinox platform will reject to load this plugin.

<2> Registration of the Native DLLs in the plugin.
All required DLLs are registered here.
Even though Equinox provides some intrinsic functionality for loading these DLLs,
it is not sufficient for DLLs which require other DLLs.

<3> The activator is needed to process the registered DLLs.
It actually tries to load all of the libraries.

.Activator.java for a Windows specific library plugin
[source,java,#ExternalLibraryActivatorWin32][Test]
----
public class Activator extends NativeLibPlugin implements BundleActivator { // <1>

	@Override
	public void loadLibraryByAbsolutePath(String libNameAbsolutePath) {
		System.load(libNameAbsolutePath); // <2>
	}

	@Override
	public void loadLibraryByName(String libName) {
		System.loadLibrary(libName); // <2>
	}
}
----
<1> The activator extends `NativeLibPlugin`.
The class `NativeLibPlugin` provides all the logic to correctly read all DLLs and report on the status.
It provides two abstract methods which have to be implemented.

<2> Here are the actual calls to the Java system to load the libraries.
This has to be implemented here to load the DLLs into the correct classpath context of the bundle.

=== Platform-specific SO libraries on Linux

The library `de.dlr.sc.virsat.external.lib.zmq.linux.x86_64` presents a good example for a Linux platform-specific third party library.
Unlike the Windows version, it does not bundle the libraries.
Instead it tries to resolve the libraries from the current system.
The plugin is set up to use an environment variable during runtime to specify the library to be loaded.
For compile time, a compatible library needs to be present as well.
This library is stored in the usual _externalLib_ folder.
It is not deployed, but it is needed for Tycho and Eclipse Compilation.
The _MANIFEST.MF_ file is described below: 

.MANIFEST.MF file of the Linux-specific ZeroMQ external library
[#ExternalLibraryManifestMfLinux]

Bundle-SymbolicName: de.dlr.sc.virsat.external.lib.zmq.linux.x86_64;singleton:=true
Bundle-Version: 4.9.1.qualifier
Bundle-Vendor: DLR (German Aerospace Center)
Bundle-RequiredExecutionEnvironment: JavaSE-1.8
Eclipse-PlatformFilter: (&  (osgi.os=linux) (osgi.arch=x86_64) ) // <1>

Export-Package: org.zeromq <5>
Bundle-Activator: de.dlr.sc.virsat.external.lib.zmq.linux.x86_64.Activator
Bundle-ActivationPolicy: lazy
Automatic-Module-Name: de.dlr.sc.virsat.external.lib.zmq.linux.x86_64
----
<1> This statement defines the platform filter.
This means that the plugin is only executed on a linux 64 bit environment.
On other environments the Equinox platform will reject to load this plugin.

<2> The bundle shape is set to `dir` which means that this plugin will be unzipped when installed into a _product_.
This helps to manipulate files when needed.

<3> The path to the library which is stored in the plugin sources, but not in the binary build.
This is needed for Maven/Tycho to compile.
In particular, Maven/Tycho does not evaluate the external libraries with environment variables correctly.

<4> Reference to the library which should be used during runtime. 
Eclipse/Equinox will evaluate the encoded environment variable and will try to load the library.

<5> The exported packages to make the content of the library usable by consuming plugins.

the _build.properties_ file needs to be prepared so it does not bundle the libraries into the final plugin.
Otherwise it seems that plugin internal resources are preferred before external resources, and the externally linked libraries never get loaded.

.build.properties which is not including the _externalLib_ folder
[#ExternalLibraryBuildPropertiesLinux]
----
source.. = src/
output.. = target/classes/
bin.includes = META-INF/,\ //<1>
               .,\
               about_files/,\
               about.html
jars.compile.order = .
----
<1> Binary includes for the final plugin assembly.
It does not include the _externalLib_ folder or one of its libraries.

To make Eclipse compile, the library has to be mentioned in the classpath.
The Eclipse compilation does not care about which library is mentioned in the _MANIFEST.MF_.

.classpath file  referencing the zmq jar
[#ExternalLibraryClasspathLinux]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<classpath>
	<classpathentry kind="con" path="org.eclipse.jd...auncher.StandardVMType/JavaSE-1.8"/>
	<classpathentry kind="con" path="org.eclipse.pde.core.requiredPlugins"/>
	<classpathentry exported="true" kind="lib" path="native_lib/zmq/zmq.jar"/> // <1>
	<classpathentry kind="src" path="src/"/>
	<classpathentry kind="output" path="target/classes"/>
</classpath>
----
<1> Reference to the _zmq.jar_ file to make Eclipse compile.

WARNING: Adding libraries as `external:...` to the _MANIFEST.MF_ file is dangerous.
Eclipse and Tycho compile against the library which is part of the source code. 
This library can be different during runtime.
Differences may lead to unexpected behavior.
Therefore, it is recommended to have the expected versions specified in the environment variables.
