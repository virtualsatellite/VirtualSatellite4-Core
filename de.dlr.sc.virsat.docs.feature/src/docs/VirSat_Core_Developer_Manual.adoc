== Getting Started

Learn about basic requirements of Virtual Satellite Developers IDE, how it is installed and begin your first development.

=== System Requirements 

Virtual Satellite Developer IDE is based on the Eclipse for Plugin Developer.
It has been extended by some additional tools that we require for our development, e.g. checkstyle or overtarget.
Additionally, the IDE contains the Concept Language, the implementation of the Generic Systems Engineering Language (GSEL).
This language is based on xtext and it is the simple entry point to start enhancing the Conceptual Data Model of Virtual Satellite for your individual needs. 

The Developers IDE currently supports the following operating system configurations:

. Windows 7 64bit with Java 8 runtime environment
. Linux 64 bit with Java 8 runtime environment

[WARNING]
.Use 64 bit Java JRE
====
Virtual Satellite does not execute on a Java 32 bit runtime environment.
====

NOTE: The Developers IDE supports newer Java versions same as eclipse. Nevertheless, Virtual Satellite still requires Java version 8. 

=== Different Ways to Develop Virtual Satellite

Virtual Satellite offers three different ways to be a developer. 
All of them require different sets of skills and offer different ways of contributing.

The first set is called *Virtual Satellite App Developer*.
Developing an App is described in the User Manual.
Apps are usually programmed directly within a project and contain project specific processing of the modeled data.
Apps can be developed directly from within Virtual Satellite and do not require special setup.

The second way is called the *Virtual Satellite Concept Developer*. 
A Concept is an extension to the Virtual Satellite Conceptual Data Model (CDM).
A Concept offers new ways of modeling to the user. 
These new ways are usually process specific, meaning depending on your understanding of modeling a spacecraft.
Once a Concept is developed it can be deployed and installed into any Virtual Satellite instance.
Thus a Concept can be easily shared and reused across projects.
Developing a concept requires some programming skills and requires to install the Virtual Satellite Developer IDE.
A Concept is developed based on the Concept Language which is an xtext implementation of our Generic Systems Engineering Language (GSEL).
This xtext language is an easy to use entry point to create new modeling items.
Code generators create all neccessary code to get started.
More advanced developers can override this generated code for further detailed modifications.

The third way is called *Virtual Satellite Infrastructure Developers*.
infrastructure Developers work on the core and basis of Virtual Satellite.
This requires a high knowledge of Virtual Satellite, Eclipse and Java.
It also requires to install the Virtual Satellite Developer IDE.

=== The Modular Conceptual Data Model

=== Virtual Satellite / Eclipse IDE Installation

|image::chapterConceptCreation/concept_creation.png[Concept Creation]

|{counter:step-concept}.
|After everything is generated and built, you should have four new plugins in the workspace.
|image::chapterConceptCreation/generated_plugins.png[Generated Plugins]
|=== 

==== Main concept plugin

The main generated plugin has the same name as the concept, and has the following contents.

image::chapterConceptCreation/main_plugin.png[Main Plugin]

The file *concept.concept* contains the description of the domain elements that can be modeled using this concept.
See section <<Generic Systems Engineering (Concept) Language>> for the details on how to write this file.
The default concept file only contains categories _Interface_ and _InterfaceEnd_.

Most of the other code in this and other concept plugins is generated based on the contents of the *condept.concept* file.
The code in directory `src` is generated once, and can be modified and extended as needed.
The code in `src-gen` is regenerated every time the concept file is changed.
This automatic generation can be toggled with a toolbar button.

image::chapterConceptCreation/button_toggle_generation.png[Toggle Generation]

===== Beans

For every Category and Structural Element in the concept file there is a class with the same name in the package `model`.
These "bean" classes provide a convenient way to programmatically access and manipulate model objects.

===== Validators

Virtual Satellite has a validation builder that runs generic and custom validators against the model data.
Validators normally check the validity and consistency of the model.
There is one generated validator as a starting point, but you can add more validators.
All additional new validators have to be registered in `plugin.xml` in the protected region in the end (this region does not get regenerated).

===== Migrators

As soon as you increase the concept version in `concept.concept`, a new migrator from the previous to the new version will be generated automatically.
The purpose of the migrator is to migrate data modeled with the older concept version to the new version.
For most changes the auto-generated migrator is sufficient, however if some custom migration logic is required, it can be added to the migrator class.

==== UI plugin

Auto-generated UI plugin contains UI snippets, commands and handlers that extend Virtual Satellite UI for this concept.

==== Test plugin

Test plugin contains some auto-generated unit tests.
You can add more unit tests as you develop your concept.

==== Concept feature

The generated concept feature bundles the main and the UI concept plugins.
It can be used to add the new concept to a custom Virtual Satellite-based RCP product.

== Generic Systems Engineering (Concept) Language 

Concepts are described using the Generic Systems Engineering Language (GSEL), or also short just _concept language_.
The GSEL is the main tool for the role of a *Virtual Satellite Concept Developer* as described in <<Different Ways to Develop Virtual Satellite>>.
The following gives a break-down on the key words and functionalities provided by the GSEL.

=== Concepts

A  _Concept_ is always the root of a concept.concept file.
It serves as the main container of the concept.
It also fulfills the task of carrying global meta-information.

A Concept may also have the following attributes:

name::
The name of the Concept.
It has to match the name of the plugin in which the concept.concept file resides in.

displayname::
A name that will be shown to the user when interacting with the concept in the UI.
For example when activating a concept, the displayname is shown.
If no displayname is defined, the concept name is shown instead.

description::
The description of the concept.

version:: 
The version number of the concept. 
Must be given in the form of `.` separated numbers (E.g. 2.0 ).

For each version number, the IDE tools generate a corresponding `concept_vVERSION.xmi` in the concept folder.
This file is used to automtically migrate old repositories based on an older concept version to the newest version.

WARNING: When editing a concept, the version number should be increased before making any changes to the concept.
Otherwise the changes will be considered to be part of the old version.
Not doing this will cause automatic migration to fail!

A concept can be filled with _<<Structural Elements>>_ and _<<Categories>>_.
Structural Elements decompose the system into its basic structure, Categories contain the actual engiering data. 
This decouples the engineering domain data from the system model's structure.
In return, new concepts can be added to a system model later on and it becomes possible open system models without all concepts being installed in Virtual Satellite.


=== Structural Elements

_Structural Elements_ decompose a system into smaller components.
For example in the _Product Structure_ concept, a system could be structurally decomposed into _System_ -> _SubSystem_ -> _Equipment_ using the _ConfigurationTree_ and _ElementConfiguration_.
Structural Elements are also the containers for data information (Categories and Properties).
To support configuration management and to bundle common data, Structural Elements can also inherit data from one another.
The instance of a Structural Element is called a _Structural Element Instance_.

A Structural Element can have the following additional attributes:

name::
The name of the Structural Element.

shortname::
An abbreviated name of the Structural Element.
Used in the UI, for example the Navigator, to compactely indicate the Structural Element of a Structural Element Instance.
If no shortname is defined, a default shortname will be generated using the capital letters of the Structural Element name.

description:: 
The description of the Structural Element.

IsRootStructuralElement::
Makes it possible to create instances directly in the _Repository_.

Applicable For::
Describes in which structural element this element's instances can be added into.
The Applicable For can have the following values:
* A list of the form _[StructuralElement1, StructuralElement2,...]_.
* _All_. Instances can be then attached to any type of Structural Element.

Inherits From::
Describes which type of Structural Elements, instances of this Structural Element can inherit data from.
Note that the concrete inheritance link between instances is defined during runtime.
At concept level, only the types between which inheritance is possible are defined.
When an instance inherits from another instance, all attached data will be passed on to the inheriting instance.
The Inherits From can have the following values:
* A list of the form _[StructuralElement1, StructuralElement2,...]_.
* _All_. Instances can then inherit from any type of Structural Element.

The following example describes a simple system decomposition.

----
StructuralElement ComponentType {
	IsRootStructuralElement;
	Applicable For [ComponentType];
}

StructuralElement Component {
	IsRootStructuralElement;
	Inherits From [ComponentType];
	Applicable For [Component];
}
----

It defines a _ComponentType_ which can be attached to the _Repository_.
It can also be nested.
As a second Structural Element, the example defines a _Component_, which can also be attached to the _Repository_.
It can be nested and inherit data from a selected _ComponentType_. 

=== Categories

Categories are the main way of assigning domain data to a Structural Element.

The instance of a Category is called a _CategoryAssignment_.

A Category may contain properties - described in the next section - and
also supports the following attributes:

name::
The name of the Category.

shortname::
An abbreviated name of the Category.
Used in the UI, for example the Navigator, to compactely indicate the Category of a Category Assignment.
If no shortname is defined, a default shortname will be generated using the capital letters of the Category name.

extends:: 
A Category may extend another Category.
The extending Category will then inherit all defined properties from the extended Category.

description::
The description of the Category.

isAbstract::
Marks a Category as abstract.
The Category can then be used for defining inheritance hierarchies, 
but the user will not be able to create Category Assignments of this Category.

Applicable For::
Describes which Structural Element Instances can have Category Assignments of this Category.
The Applicable For can have the following values:
* A list of the form _[StructuralElement1, StructuralElement2,...]_.
* _All_. The Category can then be assigned to any Structural Element Instance.

Cardinality::
Defines how many Category Assignments of this Category can be assigned to one Structural Element Instance.
If no Cardinality is defined, then the number is unlimited.

=== Properties

A Category can be extended with further data by adding _Properties_.
An instantiation of a property is called a _Property Instance_.

The GSEL supports the following property types:

FloatProperty:: 
Contains a real number. 
Can be equipped further with the following attributes:
* _description_: 
A description of the property.
* _default_: 
The default value after instantiation.
* _quantityKind_: 
The quantity kind of this property.
Only units based on the quantity kind of this attribute will be assignable in the user interface.
* _unit_: 
The default unit after instantiation.
Has to be a unit compatible to the _quantityKind_ attribute. 
 

IntegerProperty:: 
Contains an integer number.
Can be equipped further with the following attributes:
* _description_: 
A description of the property.
* _default_: 
The default value after instantiation.
* _quantityKind_: 
The quantity kind of this property.
Only units based on the quantity kind of this attribute will be assignable in the user interface.
* _unit_: 
The default unit after instantiation.
Has to be a unit compatible to the _quantityKind_ attribute. 

BooleanProperty::
Contains a Boolean value.
Can be equipped further with the following attributes:
* _description_: 
A description of the property.
* _default_: 
The default value after instantiation.

StringProperty::
Contains a string value.
Can be equipped further with the following attributes:
* _description_: 
A description of the property.
* _default_: 
The default value after instantiation.

Resource::
Contains a link to a resource on the file system.
Can be equipped further with the following attributes:
* _description_: 
A description of the property.

Reference::
Contains a reference to a Category Assignment or  in the model.
Can be equipped further with the following attributes:
* _of Type_: 
The _Category_ or _Property_ that can be referenced.
* _description_: 
A description of the property.

EReference::
Contains a reference to an EMF object outside of the model.
Can be equipped further with the following attributes:
* _of Type_: 
The EMF class that can be referenced.
* _description_: 
A description of the property.

EnumProperty::
Contains a value from an enumeration.
Each enumeration value is also associated with a real number.
Can be equipped further with the following attributes:
* _description_: 
A description of the property.
* _default_: 
The default value after instantiation.
* _quantityKind_: 
The quantity kind of the enumeration values.
* _unit_: 
The unit of the enumeration values after instantiation.
Has to be a unit compatible to the _quantityKind_ attribute. 
* _values_:
A list of enumeration values.
Given in the form _[enumValue1 = number, enumValue2 = number, ...]_.

Type::
Contains another Category Assignment.
Can be equipped further with the following attributes:
* _of Type_: 
The type of the contained Category Assignment.
* _description_: 
A description of the property.
* _quantityKind_: 
The quantity kind of the enumeration values.
* _unit_: 
The unit of the enumeration values after instantiation.
Has to be a unit compatible to the _quantityKind_ attribute. 

Any property can be defined as a dynamic array by adding _[]_ after the property name.
By adding the expression _[number]_ after a property name, a static array of properties with the given size will be created.

=== Calculations

Calculations can be defined on the concept level.
By adding a calculation to a _Category_, all instantiated _Category Assignments_ will automatically have the equations defined in the concept.
For the general syntax of declaring calculations, please check *Adjusting Equations* section in the User Manual.
This section focuses on details specific to declaring calculations on the concept level.

When declaring a concept level calculation, any properties or Categories contained in the Category can be used.
Properties from extended Categories can be accessed via _extendedCategoryName.property_.

When referencing a property that is not declared within the Category, the equation will resolve the link at calculation time.
The equation entry will be linked to the nearest Category Assignment or Property Instance found when traversing the tree towards its root.
If no fitting instance can be found, the equation will calculate `NaN`.
To clarify, consider the following example:

----
Category Config {
	FloatProperty margin;
}

Category Parameter {
	FloatProperty value;
	FloatProperty valueWithMargin;
	
	Ref: valueWithMargin = value * (1 + Config.margin);
}
----

When instantiating a _Parameter_, the new Category Assignment will search for a Property Instance of the type _Config.margin_.
If there is, for example, on root level a Category Assignment of _Config_, that will be used for the calculation.
If no _Config_ is defined on a parent Structural Element Instance, then _valueWithMargin_ will be calculated as `NaN`.

== Advanced Development Topics

Special topics are discussed in this chapter.
Developers should read this part to get a better understanding for certain decisions in Virtual Satellite.

=== Third party JAR libraries

The simplest way to load a third party JAR library is to pack it into an OSGI/Equinox plugin.
This plugin can then be used as a dependency wherever it is needed.
The following example shows how a library such as `json-simple` is integrated. The Figure "<<ExternalLibraryJson-Simple-Bundled>>" shows the file structure of the plugin.

.The external third party library json-simple bundled into a plugin.
[#ExternalLibraryJson-Simple-Bundled]
image::chapterExternalLibraries/TheJsonSimpleTPL.png[Json-Simple External Library]
 
Third party libraries get placed into the `externalLib` folder.
The sources are usually placed here as well for legal reasons.
The individual licenses and related files are stored in the `about_files` folder and mentioned in `about.html`.
Now, to make these libraries accessible from other plugins three things need to be done.

First, these libraries have to be added to the runtime classpath of the plugin as shown in Figure "<<ExternalLibraryClassPathAndPackages>>".
This can be done from the _Manifest Editor_.
The classpath gets extended by adding the new library on the _Runtime_ tab.
Then the packages of the imported library can be exported.

.The Manifest Editor for adding the third party library to the runtime classpath as well as exporting the library packages.
[#ExternalLibraryClassPathAndPackages]
image::chapterExternalLibraries/ManifestRuntimeTab.png[Manifest Editor]

Second, the external library has to be bundled into the plugin.
This way the jar which extends the runtime classpath is present and can actually be loaded.
In the _Build_ tab of the _Manifest Editor_, the `externalLib` folder and all of its sub-folders and files should be marked for the _binary build_ as shown in Figure "<<ExternalLibraryBinaryBuild>>". 

.The Manifest Editor for updating the binary build.
[#ExternalLibraryBinaryBuild]
image::chapterExternalLibraries/BuildPropertiesExternal.png[Build Properties Editor]

Third and finally, the library has to be registered for correct compilation in eclipse.
Therefore it has to be added to the build class path of the plugin.
The _Build Path Editor_  in Figure "ExternalLibraryBuildPath" can be accessed by the context menu menu:Context[Build Path > Configure Build Path...].
The libraries of the `externalLib` folder have to be listed here.
Additionally they can be linked with their source or javadoc libraries as well.

.The Build Path Editor for setting the library dependencies for eclipse compile time.
[#ExternalLibraryBuildPath]
image::chapterExternalLibraries/BuildClassPathEditor.png[Build Classpath Editor]

=== Third party Maven based JAR libraries

In case a third party library is available in the Maven repositories, it can also be added and downloaded from there.
In order to add the library as Maven dependency open the `pom.xml` file (e.g. the one from `de.dlr.sc.virsat.external.lib.jfreechart`).

</project>
----
<1> Section to specify the Maven based third party dependency.
All specified dependencies and their transitive dependencies are downloaded and stored in the `externalLib/maven` folder.
The copy process is configured thus version tags are truncated.
The downloaded jars have to be manually added to the classpath of the plugin.
Exported packages have to be registered manually as well.

<2> Section to specify excluded transitive dependencies.
Dependencies mentioned here will not be copied.


To trigger the download of the third party jars from the Maven repositories call Maven with the `downloadLibs` profile.
As soon as the dependencies are downlaoded, a 'THIRD-PARTY.txt' file is written to `aboutFiles` folder.
The file is linked into the 'about.html' of the plugin. 
License texts can be adjusted in two places. 
The first place is in the parent POM in `de.dlr.sc.virsat.external.lib/maven`.
Here it is possible to override and unify the license text.
In case Maven is not providing a license or an incorrect one it can be adjusted.
Place a `override-THIRD-PARTY.properties` in the `license` package of the plugin.


=== Platform-specific external libraries

When DLLs on Windows or so-libraries on Linux are required, bundling them and using them becomes a bit more complicated.
On Windows it is still possible to bundle them and to ship them with Virtual Satellite.
On Linux, due to the various different distributions, most libraries have to be compiled and linked to the specific system libraries.
Therefore, they cannot be shipped and bundled.
The following chapters will show how to prepare and use such platform-specific libraries with Virtual Satellite.

=== Platform-specific DLL libraries on Windows

The library `de.dlr.sc.virsat.external.lib.zmq.win32.x86_64` presents a good example for a Windows platform-specific third party library.
It bundles the DLLs for ZeroMQ plus the jar to make it available in other plugins.
Similar to the general third party libraries, the jar is placed in the _native_lib_ folder.
The Windows DLLs are placed here as well.
All these files are selected for the binary build in the _build.properties_.
As a consequence, they get exported into the final jar.
The jar is itself is included into the classpath as described in <<Third party JAR libraries>>.
A major difference is explained in the _MANIFEST.MF_

.MANIFEST.MF file of the windows specific ZeroMQ external library
[#ExternalLibraryManifestMfWin32]
----

----
<1> This statement defines the platform filter.
This means that the plugin is only executed on a win32 64 bit environment.
On other environments the Equinox platform will reject to load this plugin.

<2> Registration of the Native DLLs in the plugin.
All required DLLs are registered here.
Even though Equinox provides some intrinsic functionality for loading these DLLs,
it is not sufficient for DLLs which require other DLLs.

<3> The activator is needed to process the registered DLLs.
It actually tries to load all of the libraries.

.Activator.java for a Windows specific library plugin
[source,java,#ExternalLibraryActivatorWin32][Test]
----
public class Activator extends NativeLibPlugin implements BundleActivator { // <1>

	@Override
	public void loadLibraryByAbsolutePath(String libNameAbsolutePath) {
		System.load(libNameAbsolutePath); // <2>
	}

	@Override
	public void loadLibraryByName(String libName) {
		System.loadLibrary(libName); // <2>
	}
}
----
<1> The activator extends `NativeLibPlugin`.
The class `NativeLibPlugin` provides all the logic to correctly read all DLLs and report on the status.
It provides two abstract methods which have to be implemented.

<2> Here are the actual calls to the Java system to load the libraries.
This has to be implemented here to load the DLLs into the correct classpath context of the bundle.

=== Platform-specific SO libraries on Linux

The library `de.dlr.sc.virsat.external.lib.zmq.linux.x86_64` presents a good example for a Linux platform-specific third party library.
Unlike the Windows version, it does not bundle the libraries.
Instead it tries to resolve the libraries from the current system.
The plugin is set up to use an environment variable during runtime to specify the library to be loaded.
For compile time, a compatible library needs to be present as well.
This library is stored in the usual _externalLib_ folder.
It is not deployed, but it is needed for Tycho and Eclipse Compilation.
The _MANIFEST.MF_ file is described below: 

.MANIFEST.MF file of the Linux-specific ZeroMQ external library
[#ExternalLibraryManifestMfLinux]
----
Manifest-Version: 1.0
Bundle-ManifestVersion: 2
Bundle-Name: VirSat External Lib - JZMQ and ZeroMQ Native Libraries for 64-Bit Linux
Bundle-SymbolicName: de.dlr.sc.virsat.external.lib.zmq.linux.x86_64;singleton:=true
Bundle-Version: 4.9.1.qualifier
Bundle-Vendor: DLR (German Aerospace Center)
Bundle-RequiredExecutionEnvironment: JavaSE-1.8
Eclipse-PlatformFilter: (&  (osgi.os=linux) (osgi.arch=x86_64) ) // <1>
Eclipse-BundleShape: dir // <2>
Require-Bundle: de.dlr.sc.virsat.external.lib
Bundle-ClassPath: native_lib/zmq/zmq.jar, <3>
 external:$VS_JAR_ZMQ$, <4>
 .
Export-Package: org.zeromq <5>
Bundle-Activator: de.dlr.sc.virsat.external.lib.zmq.linux.x86_64.Activator
Bundle-ActivationPolicy: lazy
Automatic-Module-Name: de.dlr.sc.virsat.external.lib.zmq.linux.x86_64
----
<1> This statement defines the platform filter.
This means that the plugin is only executed on a linux 64 bit environment.
On other environments the Equinox platform will reject to load this plugin.

<2> The bundle shape is set to `dir` which means that this plugin will be unzipped when installed into a _product_.
This helps to manipulate files when needed.

<3> The path to the library which is stored in the plugin sources, but not in the binary build.
This is needed for Maven/Tycho to compile.
In particular, Maven/Tycho does not evaluate the external libraries with environment variables correctly.

<4> Reference to the library which should be used during runtime. 
Eclipse/Equinox will evaluate the encoded environment variable and will try to load the library.

<5> The exported packages to make the content of the library usable by consuming plugins.

the _build.properties_ file needs to be prepared so it does not bundle the libraries into the final plugin.
Otherwise it seems that plugin internal resources are preferred before external resources, and the externally linked libraries never get loaded.

.build.properties which is not including the _externalLib_ folder
[#ExternalLibraryBuildPropertiesLinux]
----
source.. = src/
output.. = target/classes/
bin.includes = META-INF/,\ //<1>
               .,\
               about_files/,\
               about.html
jars.compile.order = .
----
<1> Binary includes for the final plugin assembly.
It does not include the _externalLib_ folder or one of its libraries.

To make Eclipse compile, the library has to be mentioned in the classpath.
The Eclipse compilation does not care about which library is mentioned in the _MANIFEST.MF_.

.classpath file referencing the zmq jar
[#ExternalLibraryClasspathLinux]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<classpath>
	<classpathentry kind="con" path="org.eclipse.jd...auncher.StandardVMType/JavaSE-1.8"/>
	<classpathentry kind="con" path="org.eclipse.pde.core.requiredPlugins"/>
	<classpathentry exported="true" kind="lib" path="native_lib/zmq/zmq.jar"/> // <1>
	<classpathentry kind="src" path="src/"/>
	<classpathentry kind="output" path="target/classes"/>
</classpath>
----
<1> Reference to the _zmq.jar_ file to make Eclipse compile.

WARNING: Adding libraries as `external:...` to the _MANIFEST.MF_ file is dangerous.
Eclipse and Tycho compile against the library which is part of the source code. 
This library can be different during runtime.
Differences may lead to unexpected behavior.
Therefore, it is recommended to have the expected versions specified in the environment variables.
