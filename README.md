## Purpose

Virtual Satellite 4 is the new evolution of MBSE. With a customizable data model it can be tailored to the various needs of individual engineering tasks and project requirements. Rather than the historic approach of trying to create the data model and system engineering language that can handle all possible tasks, the new approach focuses on necessities leading to simple and easy to use applications. The data model of a Virtual Satellite 4 application can be extended by a concept. Such a concept is a set of data model extensions plus functionality to provide corresponding user interfaces and further functionality.

## Requirements 

Virtual Satellite is based on Java / Eclipse and provides an installable feature with plug-ins for your personal eclipse IDE. The following infrastructure is required:
 - Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 - 64 bit
 - Windows 7 or Linux Computer - 64 bit

## Quickstart for users

If you just want to use Virtual Satellite feel free to download it from the [Releases](https://github.com/virtualsatellite/VirtualSatellite4-Core/releases) section here on GitHub.
A manual is provided as PDF in the upcoming distributions from version 4.10.x onwards. The latest changes on the manual is written in ascii doc and can be found here: [de.dlr.sc.virsat.docs.feature/src/docs/VirSat_Core_User_Manual.adoc](de.dlr.sc.virsat.docs.feature/src/docs/VirSat_Core_User_Manual.adoc)

## Quickstart for developers

1. Open your Eclipse and switch to the Git Perspective.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Import all projects and working-sets via the ProjectSet file in _de.dlr.sc.virsat/projectSet_
6. Execute the Virtual Satellite build from _de.dlr.sc.virsat/launchers_
7. Inspect the build artifacts for the p2 repository in _de.dlr.sc.virsat.p2updatesite/target_

## Travis CI and Releases

Tarvis CI is set-up to start a build job for every branch and every new commit to the repository. It executes all relevant tests such as jUnit, SWTBot, Checkstyle, SpotBugs, etc. Making a successful pull-request into development requires all tests to pass.

Starting a Travis CI job on development or integration deploys all relevant artifacts.

For creating a new release, create a tag starting with *Release_* on the *master* branch. All artifacts are automatically deployed.

## Provided Features

- Basic modeling concepts such as product structures, mass budgeting, visualization, etc.
- Core engines such as Calculcation Engine, UI Engine, etc.
- Xtext based Concept IDE Tools for creating new concepts, including code generators

## Downloads and Deployment

Deployments are done using GitHub Releases as well as sourceforge: [![Download virtualsatellite](https://sourceforge.net/sflogo.php?type=13&group_id=3065053)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualsatellite/files/)
